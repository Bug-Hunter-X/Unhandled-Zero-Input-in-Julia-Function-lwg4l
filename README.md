# Julia Function Bug: Unhandled Zero Input

This repository demonstrates a common error in Julia functions: failing to handle a zero input. The function `myfunction` correctly squares positive and negative numbers but does not define behavior for an input of 0, leading to a runtime error.  The solution involves adding an `elseif` condition to explicitly handle the zero case.

## Bug Description:

The `myfunction` function has a missing return statement for the case when the input `x` is equal to 0. This results in an error because the function doesn't return any value under this circumstance. 

## Solution:

The provided solution adds an `elseif` condition to address the issue directly.  This ensures that the function returns a defined value (in this case, 0) for `x = 0`.
